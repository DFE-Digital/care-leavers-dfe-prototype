<h2 id="who-can-get-this" class="govuk-heading-l">Who can get this?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Your local council must give you a ‘Local Offer’ if you’re:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>between 16 and 25</li>
  <li>spent more than 13 weeks in care since the age of 14 — this includes time after you turned 16</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">Being in care means you were:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>in foster care</li>
  <li>in residential care</li>
  <li>under special guardianship</li>
  <li>in custody under the age of 18 — for example, you were in a secure children's home, secure training centre or young offender institution</li>
  <li>an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">It does not matter if you have left care or are still in care.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Some councils may also give you a Local Offer if you have been in care for less than 13 weeks as long as you either:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>left care when you were 16 or 17, and returned to your family home in a planned move for 6 months or more before you turned 18</li>
  <li>were in care before you were under a Special Guardianship Order</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">A Special Guardianship Order means a court has told someone other than your parents must care for you.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">To find out if you can get this support, you’ll need to <a href="status" class="govuk-link">check your ‘care leaver status’</a>.</p>






<h2 id="what-is-a-local-offer" class="govuk-heading-l">What is a Local Offer?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">When you leave care, your local council can help you:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>find somewhere to live</li>
  <li>with money</li>
  <li>to stay healthy - this includes mental health</li>
  <li>to start or continue education</li>
  <li>get a job</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">Every council in England has to provide support for people leaving care.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Some support is available wherever you live but depends on your <a href="status">care leaver status</a>.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">There is also support that is specific to the local council that cares for you. This means it might not be available to people in other local councils.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">This kind of support is called a ‘Local Offer’.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">It’s so you can feel safe and supported as you prepare to leave care and become an independent adult.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Moving around</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">If you move to a new area that belongs to another local council, your old local council still has to care for you. This means you get everything in their Local Offer.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">For example, if you went into care while living in Barnet and moved to Sheffield, you’ll still get Barnet Council's Local Offer.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Housing and accommodation</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Your local council must make sure you move to ‘suitable accommodation’ when you leave care. This means somewhere you feel safe and comfortable.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Your council’s Local Offer could include things like:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>finding you supported lodgings if you're not ready to live on your own</li>
  <li>discounting your Council Tax bill or making you ‘exempt’ so you do not have to pay it</li>
  <li>giving you advice so you do not fall behind on rent or bills</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">If you’re under 21 and were in care when you were 16 or 17, you get ‘priority housing’. This means the council must give you emergency housing to stop you becoming homeless.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  <a class="govuk-link" href="#">For more information about types of housing, read our finding somewhere to live guide.</a>
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Money and finances</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">As someone who has been in care, your council must give you financial support until you’re 25.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Your council’s Local Offer could include things like:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>paying for your TV license</li>
  <li>giving you money towards bills</li>
  <li>giving you money on your birthday or Christmas</li>
  <li>helping you set up a bank account or access a trust fund</li>
</ul>

  <li>making sure you have somewhere to live during the holidays if you’re at university</li>
  <li>giving care leavers work experience or jobs within the council</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Health and wellbeing</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Your council must promote and protect your physical and mental health.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">They should also support you with living a healthy lifestyle.</p>

  <li>helping you to arrange childcare, if you have children</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Relationships</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Your local council must help you to develop and maintain positive social networks.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Strong, supportive relationships are important as you become an independent adult.</p>

  <li>paying for things you need for religious reasons</li>
</ul>








<h2 id="other-support" class="govuk-heading-l">If you're receiving other support</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">As a care leaver, there is support that’s available whichever local council cares for you. This support depends on your ‘care leaver status’.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">To find out what support you can get, you’ll need to <a href="status">check your care leaver status</a>.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Your local council must provide this as well as anything in its Local Offer.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">For example, you get £1,200 a year for going to college, known as the 16 to 19 Bursary.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You should also get some money to buy a laptop for college if it’s in your council’s Local Offer.</p>






<h2 id="issues-with-support" class="govuk-heading-l">Issues with this support</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Each local council offers different support so it’s important to check what your council offers.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Every local council, by law, has to publish a document that shows what its Local Offer is.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If you’ve moved around a lot and not sure which local council should be supporting you, <a href="#">check who your local council is</a>.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If you didn’t get the support you should have had, you can use our template for getting access to missed support.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You can also <a href="guides-advice">make a formal complaint</a>.</p>
