    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="who-entitled">Who is entitled to it</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">You’re eligible for the Care Leaver's Grant if your status is ‘former relevant child’.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You’re a ‘former relevant child’ if you: 
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>are between 18 and 25</li>
      <li>spent more than 13 weeks in care since the age of 14 — this includes time after you turned 16</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Being in care means you were:  
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>in foster care</li>
        <li>in residential care or similar</li>
         <li>in supported lodgings</li>
        <li>under special guardianship</li>
        <li>in custody under the age of 18 — for example, you were in a secure children's home, secure training centre or young offender institution</li>
        <li>an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you’re a ‘relevant child’ or ‘eligible child’, you’ll be entitled to this when you turn 18.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">To find out if you're entitled to this support, <a href="home" class="govuk-link">check your care leaver status</a>.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The Care Leaver's Grant is for people in England. If you’re leaving care and live in Scotland you are entitled to the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/news/payment-for-care-leavers/" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">Care Leaver Payment</a>. If you’re in Wales, you’re entitled to the <a href="https://www.gov.wales/basic-income-pilot-care-leavers-overview-scheme?" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">Basic Income for Care Leavers in Wales</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="what-it-is">What is the Care Leaver's Grant?</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">When you leave care, your local council will give you a one-off payment towards setting up your next home.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can use this money to purchase essentials such as furniture and kitchen appliances.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Some people call it ‘Care Leavers Allowance’ or ‘Leaving Care Grant’.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Your personal advisor or someone from your local council can help you with buying what you need.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how-much">How much you'll get</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">You should get a minimum of £3,000.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You might get more, but your local council will decide the specific amount based on your individual circumstances. </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how-and-when">How and when you'll get it</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Ask your personal advisor or someone from your local council to apply for a Care Leaver Grant when you turn 18.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Once the local council agrees on the amount, they'll pay it into your bank account. </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You may get the full amount in one go or over a few months. This depends on your personal advisor and local council.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you're in a 'stay put' arrangement, you can apply at 18. But you may decide to receive the payment when you move out or turn 21.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="other-support">If you're receiving other support </h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">You’re still entitled to this support:
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>even if you’re already getting other financial support like benefits</li>
        <li>regardless of your living arrangements</li>
      </ul></p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="issues">Issues with this support</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Speak to your personal advisor or someone from your local council if you feel you are not receiving all the help you need. </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You can also <a href="#">make a complaint</a>.</p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="further-info">Further information</h2>
    <p>To find out more about Care Leaver's Grant, speak to your local council.</p>
