  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Suitable accommodation</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">Help finding suitable accommodation</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Your local council must find you suitable accommodation if you:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>are between 16 and 21 (or 25 <a href="">if you’re in full-time education</a>)</li>
    <li>have spent at least 13 weeks <a href="">in care</a>, in total, between the age of 14 to 16 (this needs to include time after your 16th birthday)</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">This also means your care leaver status is:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li><a href="status-former-relevant-child">former relevant child</a></li>
    <li><a href="status-eligible-child">eligible child</a></li>
    <li><a href="status-relevant-child">relevant child</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">If your status is qualifying child, you’ll only get this support if you’re in full-time education.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you’re not sure, you can <a href="status">check your care leaver status.</a></p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What is suitable accommodation?</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">Suitable accommodation is somewhere safe and suitable to live that must:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>consider your needs</li>
    <li>consider your wishes and feelings</li>
    <li>meet housing health and safety requirements</li>
    <li>be affordable for you</li>
    <li>meet any health or disability needs</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">It should not be too far from:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>your work</li>
    <li>your school or college</li>
    <li>where your training is taking place</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Can I see it before moving in?</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">You should be able to visit somewhere before you move in to make sure it’s safe and suitable for you.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens if it becomes unsuitable?</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">Your <a href="support-personal-adviser">personal adviser (PA)</a> or social worker must visit you when you have moved in to see how you are doing.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you find your home is not safe or suitable, your council must help you find somewhere else to live. Whilst they find you somewhere else to live, you might be given temporary <a href="">emergency accommodation</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="types-of-accommodation" class="bluebox">
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Types of accommodation</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">Whether you’re ready to live on your own or not, there are many housing options for care leavers.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">What's available to you will depend on your council. Your council may work with charities which offer options too.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Supported accommodation</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">Supported accommodation is where there are people around to help you develop life skills. It helps to prepare you for independent, adult life.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">This is sometimes called ‘supported housing’ or ‘semi-independent accommodation’.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">It includes supported lodgings, where a person or family rents a room in their home to you. These people are also called ‘hosts’.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">This is a good option if you leave care at 16 or 17 and you’re not ready to live on your own yet.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Shared accommodation</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">Shared accommodation is where you live with other young people.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">This is sometimes called ‘group houses’ or ‘shared houses’.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">You have your own bedroom but share spaces like a living room, kitchen, and bathroom.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Specialist accommodation</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">Specialist accommodation is somewhere you can live if you:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>are disabled</li>
    <li>have a health condition</li>
    <li>have difficulties with your mental health</li>
    <li>are vulnerable (at higher risk of harm)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">This is sometimes called ‘specialised support housing’.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you live here, there are always support workers available to help you.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Living on your own</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">There are different types of housing that may be available to you, like council housing (sometimes called ‘social housing’) or a privately-rented house or flat.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Your council may move you up the waiting list for council housing if you <a href="">have a priority need</a>.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">You’ll have to pay for household bills like:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>electricity and gas</li>
    <li>water</li>
    <li>council tax</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">You may be able to get <a href="#">help with housing costs</a>.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Staying with your foster family</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you're already living with a foster carer, you can choose to stay with them.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">This is called a ‘stay put’ arrangement.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">You and your foster carer must make this decision together.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Returning to your birth family</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">If it’s possible and it feels right for you, you can return to live with your birth family.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Your PA or social worker can help you with this decision.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you’re a full-time student aged 16 to 25</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">Your council must provide or pay for student accommodation during term holidays if you:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>are a full-time student</li>
    <li>are aged 16 to 25</li>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you’re in custody</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you’re 17 or younger and in custody, you’re ‘<a href="in-care">in care</a>’. This might mean you live in a:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>secure children’s home</li>
              <li>secure training centre</li>
    <li>young offender institution</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">When you leave, you may get help:</p>

    <li>finding <a href="">suitable accommodation</a></li>
    <li>with <a href="#">housing costs</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">Support depends on your <a href="status">care leaver status</a>.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you’re seeking asylum</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">You’re an ‘unaccompanied asylum-seeking child or young person’ or ‘UASC’ if you arrived in the UK:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>when you were 17 or younger</li>
    <li>alone or without a parent or adult</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">Social services will care for you until you become 18.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">When you're 18, you’ll ‘leave care’ and get:</p>

<section id="moving-areas" class="bluebox">
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Moving areas</h2>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens if you move areas</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you move to a new area under a different council, the council that cares for you will stay the same.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Your council must still give you housing support, including their <a href="local-offer">Local Offer for care leavers</a>.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">They may work with the new council to support you, but this is their decision.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">If you’re 16 or 17, your council must pay for your housing costs, like rent, bills, and other housing expenses.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you’re 18 or over</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you’re 18 or over, you’ll have to pay your own housing costs, but you may be able to get <a href="#">housing support</a>.</p>
