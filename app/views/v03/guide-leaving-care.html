        <p class="govuk-body">You do not have to leave care leave care until you’re 18.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you want to, you can leave care at 16 or 17. This is a decision that your social worker can help you with.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you leave care</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">You'll get support to start preparing early so that you feel more ready when you leave. This might start when you’re 15, 16, or 17, depending on when you leave.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Your social worker will help you plan your move out of care, or you may get a personal advisor to support you.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">After you leave care</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Your local council must support you until you’re 21, but there is support you can get until you’re 25.</p>

        <h2 id="meeting-your-personal-advisor" class="govuk-heading-l">Meeting your personal advisor</h2>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What is a personal advisor?</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">A personal advisor (PA) is the main person who will support you when you leave care.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Your social worker should introduce you to them when you’re 15, 16, or 17.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Your personal advisor must help you until you’re 21, or 25 if you want.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How they should help you</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">You’ll meet with your personal advisor at least once every 8 weeks to:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>plan and make decisions about your future (as part of your Pathway Plan)</li>
          <li>get access to support</li>
          <li>talk through any issues or worries</li>
          <li>get guidance and advice when you need it</li>
          <li>develop practical ‘life skills’ (like shopping, cooking or budgeting)</li>
          <li>get set up for independence (e.g. apply for benefits, open a bank account)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you do not get a personal advisor straight away, your social worker should help you with these things.</p>

        <h2 id="preparing-to-leave" class="govuk-heading-l">Preparing to leave</h2>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">You’ll have a statutory review meeting</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">You’ll have a long chat with a few people about your future, to discuss decisions like:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>where you’ll live</li>
          <li>whether you’ll start or continue education</li>
          <li>whether you’ll do training or get a job</li>
          <li>what support you’ll need</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">People at the meeting will include:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>your social worker</li>
          <li>your personal advisor, if you have one</li>
          <li>other people that support you (like a teacher or mentor)</li>

          <li>your carers, if you live with a foster family</li>
          <li>an independent reviewing officer (someone that makes sure things are done properly)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">You’ll have a needs assessment</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">You’ll have a ‘needs assessment’ with your social worker or personal advisor, which will feel like a chat.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">This is how they work out what advice and support you’ll need to be independent.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">This will help make your Pathway Plan too.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">You'll make a Pathway Plan</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">A Pathway Plan is a document that you work on with your personal advisor or social worker to prepare you for leaving care.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You should meet to review it at least once every 6 months.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You’ll use it to set plans and goals around things like:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>where you’ll live</li>
          <li>managing money</li>
          <li>education, training or work</li>
          <li>your health and wellbeing</li>
          <li>contact with your family (if you want to)</li>
          <li>finding your community</li>
          <li>support you’ll need</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="deciding-where-youll-live" class="govuk-heading-l">Deciding where you’ll live</h2>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Your housing rights</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Your local council must make sure you move to ‘suitable accommodation’ when you leave care. This means somewhere you feel safe and comfortable.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You may also be able to get help with living expenses if you have moved somewhere for education or training.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body"><a href="#">Find out more about housing support.</a></p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Living arrangements</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">You’ll work out where to live with your Personal Adviser or Social Worker.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you’re not ready to live on your own yet, there are options to ease you into independent life.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body"><a href="#">To learn more about your options, read our guide on finding somewhere to live.</a></p>

        <h2 id="getting-support" class="govuk-heading-l">Getting support</h2>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Support you should get</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Leaving care can be a challenging time, so your local council must support you in different areas of your life.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">What support you could get depends on your ‘care leaver status’, which is based on the time you spent in care.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body"><a href="#">Check your care leaver status.</a></p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Your Local Offer</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Your local council will offer you extra support through their Local Offer. This might include things like Council Tax discount or driving lessons.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Different councils offer different things, so <a href="#">go to your local council’s website to find their Local Offer.</a></p>
        <p class="govuk-body"><a href="#">Check who your local council is.</a></p>

        <h2 id="issues-leaving-care" class="govuk-heading-l">Issues leaving care</h2>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Having your voice heard</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">When leaving care, it’s important you feel heard when making decisions about your life.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you do not feel heard, you have the right to get an independent advocate to:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

          <li>explain things to you (like your rights)</li>
          <li>make sure you’re treated fairly</li>
          <li>make a complaint</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Making a complaint</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Before making a complaint, if you can, speak to your social worker or personal advisor first to see if they can help.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You have the right to make a complaint if you:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>did not get the support you should have had</li>
          <li>are unhappy with decisions made around your life</li>
