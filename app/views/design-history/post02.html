        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Summary</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Our first round of research revealed a strong reaction to the imagery used on the site. While images could be engaging, they occasionally caused confusion, particularly for users with limited English proficiency. To address this, we tested a mix of images and icons, focusing on the categories section of the site. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative research, we aimed to determine the most effective approach for accessibility and user understanding.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Problem Statement</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Users with limited English proficiency sometimes struggled to understand the links on our site when imagery alone was used. In addition, overly staged or unrealistic images detracted from the site's credibility. Our challenge was to explore whether icons could provide clarity while maintaining the siteâ€™s friendliness and accessibility.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What We Did</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          We introduced a mix of images and icons, applying them primarily to the categories section of the site. Testing involved:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Quantitative research to gauge user preferences.</li>
          <li>Qualitative user research to gather deeper insights, particularly from care leavers and UASC (Unaccompanied Asylum-Seeking Children).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          We developed the hypothesis that icons might help users with lower literacy or limited English find content more easily while maintaining a friendly and engaging design.

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Why We Did It</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Initial feedback highlighted that while images could be engaging, they were not always helpful for users with limited English proficiency or those unfamiliar with the context. For example, images that seemed too "staged" or overly cheerful were perceived as inauthentic. By integrating icons, we aimed to improve navigation and accessibility, making the site more intuitive for all users.

      <section>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Outcomes</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          <strong>Icons:</strong> The bold use of color in the icons was seen as a welcome addition to a GOV.UK site, making it feel friendlier and less intimidating. Most users understood the meaning of the icons. However, there was some confusion: for example, the "local" icon was mistaken for the South African flag by some UASC participants.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          <strong>Images:</strong> Images were generally well-received but needed to avoid looking overly staged or artificial. Users responded better to authentic, relatable visuals. Participants preferred images that felt natural and represented diversity without being overly polished or "happy."
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          <strong>Mix of Both:</strong> Combining images and icons provided a good balance. Icons offered clarity and simplicity, while images added visual interest and relatability.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Next Steps</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Moving forward, we plan to:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Refine the iconography to avoid cultural misinterpretations (e.g., redesigning the "local" icon).</li>
          <li>Curate a library of authentic, diverse, and natural images that resonate with users.</li>
          <li>Continue monitoring user preferences through analytics and feedback to optimize the mix of images and icons across the site.</li>
        </ul>
