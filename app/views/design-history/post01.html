        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Summary</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          We tested three distinct platform styles to determine which was most trusted and welcoming for care leavers seeking information about transitioning out of care. Additionally, we explored user behavior on mock Google search results to identify which links and designs inspired the most trust and engagement.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Problem Statement</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Care leavers often struggle to identify reliable, trustworthy sources of information as they transition to adulthood. Our goal was to understand which type of website design and branding approach best meets their needs for trust, accessibility, and usability.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What We Did</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          We designed three unique platform styles and gathered insights from care leavers and intermediaries through interviews and usability testing. The styles included:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>A straightforward GOV.UK style</li>
          <li>A DfE-branded design with imagery</li>
          <li>A third-party platform branded as “Life Carefree”</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          In addition, we created mock-ups of Google search engine results (SERPs) featuring these brands to evaluate which links care leavers were most likely to click on and trust.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Why We Did It</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Previous research highlighted varying levels of trust in different brands and sources of information among care leavers. To build a platform that users can confidently rely on, we needed to explore these perceptions and identify what inspires trust and usability.

      <section>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Outcomes</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          <strong>Google SERPs:</strong> Participants trusted links featuring the GOV.UK symbol, regardless of whether the URL pointed to a GOV.UK or a DfE-hosted page. Trust in GOV.UK branding was universal, even if participants didn’t always prefer it aesthetically.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          <strong>Platform Design:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>
            The third-party platform was perceived as resembling a charity, which was not as trusted. Additionally, the use of red was noted as triggering by some participants, associating it with danger or urgency.
          </li>
          <li>
            The GOV.UK style was seen as trustworthy but also serious, dry, and visually unappealing. Participants felt it required focused effort to navigate and lacked imagery that could aid users with language barriers.
          </li>
          <li>
            The DfE-branded design struck the best balance. It carried the trust of a government-affiliated site while leveraging imagery and color to make it more approachable and engaging, especially for users who may struggle with text-heavy content.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Next Steps</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Based on user feedback, we have chosen the DfE-branded design as the foundation for the Leaving Care website. This approach blends the necessary trustworthiness of a government-backed platform with the warmth and accessibility provided by thoughtful use of imagery and design.
